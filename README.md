# Emergency Sound Detection System

## Project Overview
This project aims to create a web-based system that uses audio processing and AI to detect emergency sounds like breaking glass or gunshots. The goal is to alert users or authorities quickly to potential emergencies.

## MVP Goal
Our MVP will focus on detecting one emergency sound with high accuracy. It will include:
- A simple web interface for monitoring.
- AI model integration for sound classification.
- An in-app notification system for alerts.

## Development Path
1. **Research and Data Collection**: Compile a dataset of emergency sounds.
2. **AI Model Development**: Train a model to recognize our target sound.
3. **Backend Setup**: Build a Node.js server for audio processing.
4. **Frontend Development**: Design a user interface for system interaction.
5. **Testing and Iteration**: Refine the system based on user feedback.
6. **Pilot Implementation**: Test the MVP in a controlled setting.

## Future Enhancements
- Support for multiple emergency sounds.
- Improved notification system for emergency services integration.
- Enhanced user interface for diverse environments.
